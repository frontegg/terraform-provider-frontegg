# Frontegg Provider

The Frontegg provider provides resources to interact with the [Frontegg] user
management platform.

The provider works with only one workspace at a time. To provision multiple
workspaces, you will need to configure multiple copies of the provider.

Note that the client ID and secret key are *not* the client ID and secret key
that appear in "Workspace Settings". You need to generate a workspace API key
and secret specifically for the Terraform provider's use in the administration
portal:

In order to interact with specific environment management capabilities you can
provide environment ID, that is displayed on environment settings at the Frontegg
portal. To configure multiple environments you will need to configure multiple
copies of provider with one environment ID per each. If no environment ID was
provided the configuration will be cross-environments.
